# A-Cinema-Management-System-in-JAVA

Built a cinema management application using database backend to store information about movies,
rooms, tickets, actors, ratings and so on. Two different users are there client and staff. Clients can
lookup and book tickets, rate movie and other activities. Staff can modify movie, show times and room
information. Used Hibernate ORM for minimizing database access and make querying of data simple.
